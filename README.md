# Luan-Dun (乱炖)

Luan-Dun (乱炖), a.k.a 大丰收, is a famous North-Eastern Chinese dish. A proper English name would be something like ["Northern Vegetable Stew with Pork"](https://omnivorescookbook.com/vegetable-stew). But I would like to call it "Delightful Chaos". As the name suggests, this dish collects a lot of good stuff and mix them together into something messy but super delicious.

I hope this repo will become something similar. Over the years, I have made plenty Jupyter notebook demos for students I have worked with, or for some small side projects during my productive procrastination period (which happens a lot!), or for teaching myself some new tricks. It is a shame that all these notebooks are just scattered around. So I think I will gradually organize them here in hope that it will become handy to not just me in the future.
